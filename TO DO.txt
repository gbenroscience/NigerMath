PARSER:

1.Parser cannot resolve:

sum(6!,3,4..):whereas it can resolve: sum(sin6,3,5,2+2...)


2. Parser wrongly resolves

   sum(6,5,A)...where A is a defined variable.

 it interpretes it as 6+(5*A).

3.Parser wrongly resolves sort(4,3,5,sin(3),cos2,ln5)
It multiplies the number closest to an operator e.g 5 and sin3

4.(0.5)(0.68+0.33) is syntax error, but (0.5*1)(0.68+0.33),
(1/2)(0.68+0.33) e.t.c. are not
