      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome To  <font style ="font-style: italic">MathematicalNigerian </font> ,
          a set of mathematical tools  built specifically for students and researchers,
       but targeted generally at an audience that need to carry out basic calculations without having to learn strenuous syntax.
       The software is an high power scientific calculator replete with extensive graphing, calculations and equation solving ability.
       Employing easily understood syntax, the software is the tool of choice for anyone desiring access to powerful mathematical computing
       power combined with syntax as close to normal mathematics as possible.You can use it just like a handheld calculator by clicking buttons,
       or you can use your keyboard to type the mathematical expressions that you want the calculator to evaluate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the functionality included in <font style ="font-style: italic">MathematicalNigerian </font>
