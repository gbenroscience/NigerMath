        <li> <font style="font-style: oblique"><B>WORKING WITH THE CALCULATOR: </B></font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The calculator mode is activated by default when the tool is switched on.Basic utilities
        offered here have been highlighted before and we will only check out how to use them.<br>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li> <b>Variable and constants creation and storage:</b>

                <ul> <li> Naming of variables and constants:<br>
                      Variables and constants follow a simple naming convention. They must start with θ or π or a single letter of the alphabet
                      (upper or lowercase), <b>that must not be the E letter</b>.They may consist of this alone or be followed by a string of digits (0-9).<br>
                      
                          So for instance:
                          <ul>
                              <li> x is a valid variable name </li>
                              <li> x1 is a valid variable name  </li>
                              <li> x1x is an invalid variable name  </li>
                              <li> xx is an invalid variable name  </li>
                              <li> x111112 is a valid variable name  </li>
                          </ul>
                          where x cannot be E but can be any of A-Z, a-z, θ or π.
                     
                    </li></ul>

                <p> Variables may be created in 2 ways.</p>
                <ul><li> Single variable creation.
                        <p>  Is done with the simple syntax: <b>variablename</b> = <i>variablevalue</i><br>An example would be x = 2.9393 or y1 = 29.2. Hit the enter key after typing this command
  and observe that the variable is displayed on the variables table. If the variable has been created before, then the tool simply updates
  its value on the table with whatever new value is specified in the command.If the variable specified has been created as a constant before
  then the tool sends a message describing the immutability of constants.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
<ul>
                    <li> Variable set creation.

              <p> This command works with the keyword, 'vars:' The syntax is: <b>vars: var1,var2,var3...varN</b> = <i>val1,val2,val3....valN</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An good example is: 'vars: a,b,r,e,t = 12,34,5,67,-22'. Hit the enter key after typing this command
  and observe that the variables are displayed on the variables table. If any of the variables have been created before, then the tool simply updates
  its value on the table with whatever new value is specified in the command.If any of the variables specified has been created as a constant before
  then the tool sends a message describing the immutability of constants.
                        </p>


                    </li>
                <li> Variables may also be created by clicking on the variables table and typing the singular form of the creation
                command in the dialog that emerges.</li>
                </ul>

              
                
<ul>
                    <li> Constant set creation.

              <p> This command works with the keyword, 'const:' The syntax is: <b>const: var1,var2,var3...varN</b> = <i>val1,val2,val3....valN</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An good example is: 'const: a,b,r,e,t = 12,34,5,67,-22'. Hit the enter key after typing this command
  and observe that the variables are displayed on the constants table. If any of the constants have been created before as a constant,  then the tool sends a
  message describing the immutability of constants.However, If any of the constants specified has been created as a variable before
  then the tool requests the user to signify if the variable should be changed to <i>'read only'</i>, that is constant form.If the user agrees then
  the variable is destroyed and a constant going by that name is created and displayed on the constants table.
                        </p>


                    </li>
                        <li> Constants may also be created by clicking on the constants table and typing the full constant creation
                command in the dialog that emerges.<br></li>
                </ul>


            </li>

            <li> <b>Mathematical expression evaluation</b>

            Mathematical expressions may be entered from the system keyboard or from the keyboard utility provided by this tool.
            Pressing enter on the system keyboard or pressing the equals sign on the normal mode of the keyboard utility will prompt the tool to
            evaluate the expression and deliver the output to the output display.<br>
            The tool will only allow the user to use a variable or constant that has been created before in a mathematical expression.
            For example, to evaluate the expression: <b>3xsin(x+2^44x) </b>, the user would have made the statement  ...say:<br>
          <pre>
                                     x = 2  ( hit the enter key)<br>
                                     3xsin(x+2^44x)   ( hit the enter key)<br>
          </pre>
            </li>

            <li> <b>Statistical Calculations</b>

            Data sets may be passed to common statistical operators which then operate on them and generate results. Common functions include
            sum(data set), prod(data set), avg(data set), s_d(data set), vars(data set),rng(data set),m_rng(data set), rms(data set)
            sort(data set),mode(data set) and so on.
            The format of data set is simply.......num1,num2,num3..... that is a comma separated list of numbers.
            The data set may also contain other mathematical expressions..e.g 2,3,sin(4),7.....
            To evaluate the standard deviation of the data set: <b> 3,-9,2,3,4,12,56</b>, the user would make the statement  ...say:<br>
          <pre>
                                     s_d(3,-9,2,3,4,12,56)
          </pre>
            and then hit the enter key.
            </li>
