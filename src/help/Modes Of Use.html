         The <font style ="font-style: italic">MathematicalNigerian </font> presents the user with 2 modes of usage.These are:<br>
      </p>
<ol>
    <li> <font style="font-style: italic"><B>The Calculator Mode:</B></font><br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the user has the capacity to carry out basic mathematical calculations, store variables and constants and formulae and use them
       whenever they are needed. This mode is provided with a keyboard from which the user can enter characters,digits, operators and
       symbols into the <font style="font-style: italic">calculator input display.</font>
       <ul>
       <li>
         The Calculator Input Display: <br>
              The input display can be found at the top of the interface and by default, its background is dark gray. The user can enter values into
              it and when the equals button on the calculator keyboard is pressed, or the user presses the enter key on the machine's keyboard,the input in the display
              is evaluated and an answer is displayed in the output display beneath the command-line display.
       </li>
       <li>
           The Calculator Keyboard:<br>
           Simple utility that enables the user to enter values into the Calculator Input Display.
           By pressing the equals button on it, the expressions can be evaluated and the results displayed either on the
           output display or in the tables depending on the nature of the input.<br>
       </li>
       <li>
           The Output Display:<br>
           The result of all calculations done in <font style="font-style: italic">MathematicalNigerian</font> is almost always shown on this display. It is located just below the
           command-line utility and is labeled 'OUTPUT LINE'.

       </li>
       <li>
           The Tables:<br>
           Are 5 in number :

           <dl>
               <dt> Variables Table </dt>
               <dd> Displays all created variables  and the value stored in them </dd>
               <dt> Constants Table </dt>
               <dd> Displays all created constants  and the value stored in them </dd>
               <dt> Constants Table </dt>
               <dd> Displays all created constants  and the value stored in them </dd>
               <dt> Formulae Table </dt>
               <dd> Displays all created formulae </dd>
               <dt> History Table </dt>
               <dd> Displays all expressions evaluated on the calculator input display and the time when the evaluation was done. </dd>
               <dt> Matrix Table </dt>
               <dd> Displays all created Matrix Variables. </dd>

           </dl>

       </li>
       </ul>
</li>

<li>
    
 <font style="font-style: italic"><B>The Command-Line Mode:</B></font><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode makes available all features available in the calculator mode and more.
     In addition to the calculating power that it makes available, it allows users to tackle a lot of technical problems. From Matrix Arithmetic,
     to numerical calculus, to linear simultaneous equations, to graphing, to equation root finding and so on, the command-line utility makes
     a lot of functionality available. Also, it operates using specific commands that are easy to recall, since they are normal mathematical
     terms.No doubt, the command -line would hugely please those who seek more than just a calculating experience.
